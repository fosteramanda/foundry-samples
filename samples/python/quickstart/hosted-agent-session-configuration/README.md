# Quickstart: Configure Session Idle Timeout for a Hosted Agent

This sample shows how to use **`sessionConfiguration.idleTimeoutSeconds`** in `azure.yaml` to control how long a hosted agent session stays alive after the last user interaction — and how to deploy it with the [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=azd).

## What it does

When users interact with a hosted agent, each conversation runs in a **session** — a stateful container that keeps the agent process alive between messages. By default, a session is terminated after **15 minutes (900 seconds)** of inactivity.

`sessionConfiguration.idleTimeoutSeconds` is a **deploy-time property** on the hosted agent. You declare it in `azure.yaml` and `azd` applies it when the agent version is created — no SDK code required.

| Use case | Recommended timeout |
|----------|-------------------|
| Quick Q&A agents | 300s (5 min) — saves resources |
| Interactive coding assistants | 1800s (30 min) — avoids mid-task resets |
| Long-running data analysis | 3600s (60 min) — maximum allowed |

## Key configuration

The idle timeout is set on the agent service in [`azure.yaml`](azure.yaml):

```yaml
services:
  hosted-agent-session-configuration:
    host: azure.ai.agent
    kind: hosted
    # ... other fields ...
    sessionConfiguration:
      idleTimeoutSeconds: 1800  # 30 minutes
```

### Valid range

| Property | Min | Default | Max |
|----------|-----|---------|-----|
| `idleTimeoutSeconds` | 300 | 900 | 3600 |

Values outside this range are rejected during provisioning/deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)**
   - [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (1.25 or later) and the unified Foundry CLI extension: `azd ext install microsoft.foundry`
   - This sample requires the **`azure.ai.agents` extension `>=1.0.0-beta.11`** (declared in [`azure.yaml`](azure.yaml) under `requiredVersions`)
   - Authenticated: `azd auth login`
2. **Azure CLI** — installed and authenticated: `az login`
3. **Python 3.10 or higher** — verify with `python --version`

> [!NOTE]
> You do **not** need an existing [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-foundry?view=foundry) project or model deployment to get started — `azd provision` creates them for you.

## Run and deploy with `azd`

No cloning required. Create a new folder, point `azd` at the manifest on GitHub, and it downloads the sample and adopts its `azure.yaml` as the project manifest:

```bash
# Create a new folder for the agent and navigate into it
mkdir session-config-agent && cd session-config-agent

# Initialize from the manifest — azd reads it, downloads the sample,
# and adopts its azure.yaml as the project manifest
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/quickstart/hosted-agent-session-configuration/azure.yaml

# Provision Azure resources (Foundry project, model deployment, App Insights)
azd provision

# Run the agent locally (handles env vars, Docker build, and startup)
azd ai agent run
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you've already cloned this repository, pass a local path to the manifest instead:
> `azd ai agent init -m <path-to-repo>/samples/python/quickstart/hosted-agent-session-configuration/azure.yaml`

Invoke the local agent:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

Deploy to Foundry — the configured idle timeout is applied to the created agent version:

```bash
# Build, push, and deploy the agent to Foundry
azd deploy

# Invoke the deployed agent
azd ai agent invoke "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

To change the timeout, edit `idleTimeoutSeconds` in `azure.yaml` and re-run `azd deploy`.
