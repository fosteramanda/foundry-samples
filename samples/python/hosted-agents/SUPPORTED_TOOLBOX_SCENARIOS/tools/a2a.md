# A2A (Agent-to-Agent)

Configure a Foundry-hosted caller agent to delegate requests to a remote A2A-compatible agent
through a Foundry Toolbox.

> This page covers the caller-side `azure.yaml`. The configuration comes from the validated
> [A2A delegation sample](../../agent-framework/a2a/01-delegation/). Use the sample's
> [caller `azure.yaml`](../../agent-framework/a2a/01-delegation/caller/azure.yaml) as the source of
> truth.

## Prerequisites

- A remote agent with an incoming A2A endpoint and agent card. The
  [sample executor](../../agent-framework/a2a/01-delegation/executor/) demonstrates how to enable
  incoming A2A on a Foundry-hosted Responses agent.
- The remote agent's A2A endpoint URL.
- A caller implementation that reads `TOOLBOX_NAME` and connects to the named Foundry Toolbox.

## Configure the caller in `azure.yaml`

The caller's `azure.yaml` declares the project, remote A2A connection, toolbox, and hosted caller
agent together:

```yaml

### Remote A2A connection

The `math-expert-a2a` service defines how Foundry reaches the remote agent:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `host: azure.ai.connection` | Declares a Foundry project connection. |
| `uses: [ai-project]` | Creates the connection in the same Foundry project as the caller. |
| `category: RemoteA2A` | Identifies the target as an A2A agent. |
| `target: '${a2a_executor_endpoint}'` | Prompts for and stores the remote A2A endpoint during project initialization. |
| `authType: UserEntraToken` | Forwards the calling user's Microsoft Entra token to the remote agent. |
| `audience: https://ai.azure.com` | Requests a token accepted by the Foundry-hosted A2A endpoint. |
| `metadata.AgentCardPath` | Locates the remote agent card used for A2A capability discovery. |

### A2A toolbox

The `a2a-delegation-tools` service exposes the remote connection as a toolbox tool:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `host: azure.ai.toolbox` | Declares a Foundry Toolbox. |
| `uses` | Ensures the toolbox is created in `ai-project` after `math-expert-a2a`. |
| `type: a2a_preview` | Adds the A2A tool type. |
| `name` and `description` | Tell the model when to delegate to the remote agent. |
| `connection: math-expert-a2a` | References the `azure.ai.connection` service by name. |
| `agent_card_path: agentCard/v0.3` | Identifies the agent card path exposed by the remote endpoint. |

Use `connection`, not the legacy `project_connection_id`, when the connection is another service in
the same `azure.yaml`.

### Hosted caller agent

The caller agent lists the project, connection, and toolbox under `uses`, so `azd` provisions the
dependencies before the agent. Its environment variables use the current `env` map schema:

```yaml
uses:
  - ai-project
  - math-expert-a2a
  - a2a-delegation-tools
env:
  AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: ${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
  TOOLBOX_NAME: ${TOOLBOX_NAME}
```

The caller code uses `TOOLBOX_NAME` to find the toolbox. Foundry then discovers the
`a2a_preview` tool and executes A2A calls through the server-side connection.
