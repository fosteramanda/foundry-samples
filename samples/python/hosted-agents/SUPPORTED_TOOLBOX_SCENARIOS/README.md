## Create the toolbox

Choose a scenario guide above first. It describes the tool-specific configuration and any connection,
resource, or authentication prerequisites.

### Foundry Toolkit in VS Code

1. Sign in to the **Foundry Toolkit** and open **Tool Catalog**.
2. On the **Toolboxes** tab, select **Create Your Toolbox**.
3. In the **Included** panel, select **+ Add** and choose the tool described by the scenario guide.
4. Complete the tool configuration, name the toolbox, and select **Publish**.
5. Open the published toolbox and copy its MCP endpoint for clients that connect by endpoint.

### `azd` CLI

Use `azd` 1.27.1 or later and install the unified Foundry extension bundle with
`azd ext install microsoft.foundry`.

Each scenario guide provides the required `toolbox.yaml` or `azure.yaml` entries.

- For a standalone toolbox, run `azd ai toolbox create <toolbox-name> --from-file
  ./toolbox.yaml`. The first version becomes the default, and the command prints the versioned MCP
  endpoint. Set that endpoint as `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` for the consuming agent.
- For a toolbox declared alongside an agent in `azure.yaml`, deploy the toolbox service with `azd`.
  The agent can reference it through `uses` and resolve it by `TOOLBOX_NAME`; no copied endpoint is
  required.
