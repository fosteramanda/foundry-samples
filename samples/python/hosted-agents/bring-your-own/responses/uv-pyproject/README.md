# What this sample demonstrates

A minimal Bring Your Own hosted agent using the **Responses protocol** and an existing Python project managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It demonstrates how `azd ai agent init` detects `pyproject.toml`, how remote code deployment consumes `uv.lock`, and how `uv.toml` enables system TLS certificates during dependency installation.

## How it works

The agent forwards user input to a model deployed in Microsoft Foundry and returns the model response through the Responses protocol. The code is intentionally small so the dependency-management and existing-code initialization flow stays visible.

See [main.py](src/uv-pyproject-python-responses/main.py) for the implementation.

### Dependency management

The source directory contains:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pyproject.toml` | Declares project metadata, Python compatibility, and dependencies. |
| `uv.lock` | Pins the complete dependency graph for reproducible remote builds. |
| `uv.toml` | Sets `system-certs = true` so uv uses the operating system certificate store. |

The committed `azure.yaml` selects `remote_build` dependency resolution. During deployment, the hosted build installs the dependencies declared by `pyproject.toml` using the lockfile and uv configuration.

If you change dependencies, update and verify the lockfile:

```bash
uv lock
uv sync --frozen
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.13 or later**
2. **uv** — [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
3. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
4. **Azure CLI** — [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
5. The unified Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

6. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   az login
   ```

You do not need an existing Foundry project or model deployment. The `azd` flow can create them.

## Option 1: Initialize from existing code with `azd`

Clone the samples repository, then copy only the existing Python project to a new folder. This intentionally leaves out the committed `azure.yaml` so `azd` can create the agent project from code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples
cp -R samples/python/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/responses/uv-pyproject/src/uv-pyproject-python-responses ../uv-pyproject-agent
cd ../uv-pyproject-agent
```

Verify the locked environment:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
```

Initialize the current directory:

```bash
azd ai agent init
```

Choose the following options when prompted:

1. **Use the code in the current directory**
2. **Code** deployment
3. Runtime **Python 3.13**
4. Entry point **main.py**
5. Dependency resolution **Remote build**

The generated `azure.yaml` references the current source directory while preserving `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `uv.toml` for deployment.

### Provision, run, and invoke

```bash
azd provision
azd ai agent run
```

In another terminal:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

### Deploy and invoke

```bash
azd deploy
azd ai agent invoke "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

## Option 2: Initialize directly from the sample manifest

To adopt the complete sample without copying the source directory first:

```bash
mkdir uv-pyproject-agent && cd uv-pyproject-agent
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/responses/uv-pyproject/azure.yaml
azd provision
azd ai agent run
```

## Option 3: Run manually or with the Foundry Toolkit

Install the locked environment:

```bash
cd src/uv-pyproject-python-responses
uv sync --frozen
```

Set the required environment variables:

```bash
export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<deployment-name>"
az login
```

Start the agent:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python main.py
```

The agent listens on `http://localhost:8088`. In VS Code, select the interpreter at `.venv`, press **F5**, and use the Foundry Toolkit Agent Inspector to send requests.

## Container build

The included Dockerfile also installs from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`:

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t uv-pyproject-agent src/uv-pyproject-python-responses
docker run --rm -p 8088:8088 \
  -e FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT \
  -e AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
  uv-pyproject-agent
```

## Troubleshooting

### uv reports a system certificate error during remote build

Keep `uv.toml` in the deployed source directory next to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`:

```toml
system-certs = true
```

This allows uv to use system TLS certificates when resolving packages.

### The lockfile is out of date

If `uv sync --frozen` reports that `uv.lock` does not match `pyproject.toml`, regenerate and commit it:

```bash
uv lock
uv sync --frozen
```
