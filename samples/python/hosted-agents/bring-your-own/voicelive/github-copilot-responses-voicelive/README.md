# What this sample demonstrates

A voice-friendly hosted agent that combines the
[GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk), the Foundry
**Responses protocol**, and a bring-your-own Foundry model. The agent streams
assistant text and short tool-status messages that VoiceLive can synthesize while
Copilot is working.

## How it works

The hosted agent uses the Foundry project endpoint as an Azure provider for the
Copilot SDK. `DefaultAzureCredential` acquires a managed-identity token for
`https://ai.azure.com/.default`, so the default deployment does not require a
GitHub token or model API key.

Each Responses request is forwarded to a persistent Copilot session. Assistant
message deltas become Responses text deltas, tool starts become short status
messages, and a voice-mode instruction keeps the final answer concise and
speech-friendly. See
[`main.py`](src/github-copilot-responses-voicelive/main.py).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | For BYOK | Foundry project endpoint. Injected automatically when hosted and configured by `azd ai agent run` locally. |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | For BYOK | Foundry model deployment name. The default `azure.yaml` provisions `gpt-5.4-mini`. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For GitHub model | Optional alternative to BYOK. Use a fine-grained PAT with **Copilot Requests: Read-only**. |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_MODEL` | No | Optional Copilot model selection in GitHub-token mode. |
| `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID` | No | Session ID used to resume Copilot conversation state. |

If both modes are configured, the Foundry BYOK model takes precedence.

## Prerequisites

1. A Foundry project with a deployed model, or permission to create them with
   `azd provision`.
2. **Python 3.10 or later.**
3. Azure CLI authentication (`az login`) for local BYOK authentication.
4. The hosted agent's managed identity needs **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** on the Foundry account. The Copilot SDK provider sends requests to
   `/openai/v1/responses`, which requires the account-level
   `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/responses/write` data action.
   Assign the role to the hosted agent's `*-AgentIdentity` service principal
   after the first deployment, then allow time for RBAC propagation.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
   1.27.1 or later.
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   az login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

```bash
mkdir github-copilot-responses-voicelive
cd github-copilot-responses-voicelive
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/voicelive/github-copilot-responses-voicelive/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to select an existing Foundry project and model deployment or
create new resources.

### Provision, run, and invoke locally

```bash
azd provision
azd ai agent run
```

In another terminal:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is two plus two?"
```

The agent also accepts direct Responses requests:

```bash
curl -sS -N -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"What is two plus two?","stream":true}'
```

### Deploy and invoke

```bash
azd deploy
azd ai agent invoke "What is two plus two?"
```

To stream hosted logs:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

1. Install the
   [Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)
   and the VS Code Python extension.
2. Create or select a Python environment and install the complete dependency
   graph:

   ```bash
   pip install -r src/github-copilot-responses-voicelive/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the values from
   [`src/github-copilot-responses-voicelive/.env.example`](src/github-copilot-responses-voicelive/.env.example).
4. Press **F5**. The Toolkit generates local task files, starts the agent, and
   opens Agent Inspector.
5. Use **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent** to deploy the code and select
   CPU and memory settings.

## Use the deployed agent with VoiceLive

After deployment, run the shared VoiceLive microphone client:

```bash
pip install "azure-ai-voicelive[aiohttp]==1.3.0b1" azure-identity pyaudio
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/voicelive/client/voicelive_client.py
python voicelive_client.py \
  --endpoint "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com" \
  --agent-name "github-copilot-responses-voicelive" \
  --project-name "<project-name>"
```

The client uses `DefaultAzureCredential`. Speak into the microphone and the
agent's Responses output is returned as synthesized speech.

## Use the GitHub Copilot model instead

For local development, comment out the Foundry variables in `.env` and set a
fine-grained `GITHUB_TOKEN`. For deployment, comment
`AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` and uncomment `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `azure.yaml`.

Classic `ghp_` tokens are not supported. Use a fine-grained `github_pat_`, OAuth
`gho_`, or GitHub App user `ghu_` token.

## Troubleshooting

**Provider returns HTTP 401:** find the hosted agent's `*-AgentIdentity` service
principal and assign it **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** at the Foundry
account scope. This role is required for the Copilot SDK provider's direct
`POST /openai/v1/responses` request. Allow time for RBAC propagation before
retrying.

**No assistant text appears:** confirm that the selected model supports the
Responses API and that `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` exactly matches the
deployment name.
