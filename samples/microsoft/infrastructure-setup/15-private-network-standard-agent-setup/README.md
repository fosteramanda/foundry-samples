# Azure AI Agent Service: Standard Agent Setup with E2E Network Isolation

This infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution deploys a network-secured Azure AI agent environment with private networking and role-based access control (RBAC).

[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmeerakurup%2Ffoundry-samples%2Fdharkumar%2Fbyo-vnet-update%2Fsamples%2Fmicrosoft%2Finfrastructure-setup%2F15-private-network-standard-agent-setup%2Fmain.json)


## Steps to deploy

Make sure you have an active Azure subscription that allows registering resource providers. For example, subnet delegation requires the Microsoft.App provider to be registered in your subscription. If it's not already registered, run the commands below:

```
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.KeyVault'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.MachineLearningServices'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Search'
```

1. Create new (or use existing) resource group:

```bash
    az group create --name <new-rg-name> --location <your-rg-region>
```

2. Deploy the main.bicep

```bash
    az deployment group create --resource-group <new-rg-name> --template-file main.bicep
```

**NOTE:** To access your Foundry resource securely, please using either a VM, VPN, or ExpressRoute.

**NOTE:** If you would like to bring your existing deployed resources such as CosmosDB, AI Search, Storage, and virtual network, please update the following lines of the Bicep template in the main.bicep file with your resource ID. 
- For existing AI Search, line 77.
- For existing Storage, line 79.
- For existing CosmosDB, line 81.
- For existing virtual network, line 65.

## Architecture Overview

For more details on the networking set-up, see our documentation on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/virtual-networks).

### Network Security Design

The deployment creates an isolated network environment:

- **Virtual Network (192.168.0.0/16)**
  - Agent Subnet (192.168.0.0/24): Hosts Agent client for Agent workloads
  - Private endpoint Subnet (192.168.1.0/24): Hosts private endpoints

- **Private Endpoints**
  - AI Foundry
  - AI Search
  - CosmosDB
  - Storage


- **Private DNS Zones**
  - privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
  - privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com
  - privatelink.documents.azure.com
  - privatelink.file.core.windows.net
  - privatelink.openai.azure.com
  - privatelink.search.windows.net
  - privatelink.services.ai.azure.com

### Core Components

1. **AI Foundry resource**
   - Central orchestration point
   - Manages service connections
   - Network-isolated capability hosts

2. **AI Project**
   - Workspace configuration
   - Service integration
   - Agent deployment

3. **Supporting Services for Standard Agent Deployment**
   - Azure AI Search
   - CosmosDB
   - Storage Account

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Managed Identity**
  - Zero-trust security model
  - No credential storage
  - Platform-managed rotation

- **Role Assignments**
  - AI Search: Index Data Contributor, Service Contributor
  - CosmosDB: Operator Role
  - Storage: Blob Data Owner

### Network Security

- Public network access disabled
- Private endpoints for all services
- Service endpoints for Azure services
- Network ACLs with deny by default

## Deployment Options

**Note:** Currently the only deployment option is through this Bicep template. 

### Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)

1. Create new (or use existing) resource group:

```bash
    az group create --name <new-rg-name> --location <your-rg-region>
```

2. Deploy the main.bicep

```bash
    az deployment group create --resource-group <new-rg-name> --template-file main.bicep
```

## Module Structure

```
modules-network-secured/
├── add-project-capability-host.bicep               # Configuring the project's capability host
├── ai-account-identity.bicep                       # Setting the account's RBAC configurations

├── private-endpoint-and-dns.bicep                  # Creating virtual networks and DNS zones. 
├── standard-dependent-resources.bicep              # Deploying CosmosDB, Storage, and Search
├── subnet.bicep                                    # Setting the subnet for Agent network injection
├── validate-existing-resources.bicep               # Validate existing CosmosDB, Storage, and Search to template deployment
└── vnet.bicep                                      # Deploying a new virtual network
```
**Note:** If you bring your own VNET for this template, ensure the subnet for Agents has the correct subnet delegation to Microsoft.App/environments. If you have not specificed the delegated subnet, the template will complete this for you. 

## Limitations
- The capability host sub-resources of resource/Project must be deleted before deleting the resource/Project resource itself. You can use the script as sample to delete it or can be done in alternate ways via ARM. This restriction would be removed in next revision (coming soon).
    - [Run delete script](../utils/deleteCaphost.sh)
- If you want to delete your Foundry resource and Standard Agent with secured network set-up from the Azure Portal, delete your AI Foundry resource and virtual network last. Before deleting the virtual network, ensure to delete and purge your AI Foundry resource. Navigate to __Manage deleted resources__, then select your subscription and the Foundry resource you would like to purge. 

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Review role assignments
2. Monitor network security
3. Check service health
4. Update configurations as needed

### Troubleshooting
1. Verify private endpoint connectivity
2. Check DNS resolution
3. Validate role assignments
4. Review network security groups
